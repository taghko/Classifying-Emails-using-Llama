# Classifying-Emails-using-Llama 
Every day, professionals wade through hundreds of emails, from urgent client requests to promotional offers. 
It's like trying to find important messages in a digital ocean. 
But AI can help staying afloat by automatically sorting emails to highlight what matters most.

Intent of this project is to build an intelligent email assistant using Llama, to help users automatically classify their incoming emails. 
The system will identify which emails need immediate attention, which are regular updates, and which are promotions that can wait or be archived.
